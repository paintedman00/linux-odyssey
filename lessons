## History of Operating Systems

### 1950s - 1960s - 1970s

**Operating System (OS):**  
- The concept of a unified program or kernel didn't exist.
- Anyone wanting to run a program had to find its code, compile it, and then execute it.

**1969:**  
- The first comprehensive OS was created by **AT&T** (American Telephone & Telegraph Company).
- Bell Labs, part of AT&T, developed **UNIX**, led by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie.

**1970:**  
- UNIX was made available to the public, but it was expensive and not editable (Not Free / Closed Source).

**1978:**  
- **BSD** (Berkeley Software Distribution) became stable, created at the University of California, Berkeley.

**Prof. Andrew Tanenbaum:**  
- The first person to write 12,000 to 24,000 lines of code, creating an OS called **Minix**.

**1983:**  
- Richard Stallman, an AI engineer at MIT, introduced a free OS.
- He wrote a kernel named **Hurd**, a compiler named **GCC**, and an editor named **Emacs**.
- He aimed to create an open-source OS called **GNU** (GNU's Not Unix).

**1984:**  
- Established the **Free Software Foundation (FSF)** to promote free software.

### Meaning of Free Software:
1. Freedom to study the code's structure.
2. Permission to modify and distribute it.
3. Use for any purpose.

- Created the **GPL (General Public License)** for open-source software.
- Software labeled with DPL or copyleft is open-source.

**Stallman and Tanenbaum:**  
- Introduced an improved version of BSD, which was still commercial.

**1991:**  
- Linus Torvalds, a student of Tanenbaum, created **Linux**.
- Named it **GNU/Linux** to honor Tanenbaum's influence.

**AT&T:**  
- Later made their BSD product free due to financial losses (**FreeBSD**).

**1991:**  
- Bill Gates developed operating systems like **NT, Win 11-NC, and DOS**.

## Types of Operating Systems and Release Years:

- **1992:** Debian
- **1994:** Red Hat
- **1993:** Suse (chameleon in German, originally for NetWare)
- **1995:** Slackware

### Note:
After 1995, no new OS was introduced; subsequent systems were distributions of the above.

**DistroWatch.com:**  
- A site to explore various Linux distributions.

## Differences Among Linux Distributions:
1. Hardware support for specific devices.
2. Package support.
3. Kernel features.

---

## Popular Linux Distributions:

**Debian Base:**
1. **Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Xubuntu** (sponsored by Canonical)
   - **Ubuntu:** General use, user-friendly.
   - **Kubuntu:** KDE desktop environment.
   - **Xubuntu:** Lightweight, XFCE desktop environment.
2. **Kali** (formerly Backtrack)
   - **Kali:** Security and penetration testing.

**Red Hat Base:**
3. **Fedora**
   - **Fedora:** Cutting-edge features, Red Hat sponsored.
4. **OpenSuse**
   - **OpenSuse:** Versatile, community-driven.
5. **CentOS**
   - **CentOS:** Enterprise-level, free Red Hat clone.
6. **Knoppix**
   - **Knoppix:** Live CD for system rescue.

### Package Management:
- Package management differs across distributions.
- **Unix**: Refers to software as ports.
- **Two main package managers:**
  - **apt** (Debian, Ubuntu, Kali)
  - **yum/dnf** (Red Hat, Fedora)

### Package Managers:
- **Red Hat**: Yum, DNF, RPM (Rocky, Fedora)
- **Debian**: Apt, dpkg (Ubuntu, Kali)

## Key Points:

### Types of Operating Systems:
1. Unix
2. Linux
3. Mac
4. Windows
5. Android
6. Sun Solaris

*(All are based on Linux except Windows)*

### Security:
- Windows has better default security.
- Linux can be more secure with proper configuration.

## Fun Fact:
- The penguin mascot for Linux is named **TUX**.
